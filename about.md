My name is Gustavo Belloni Metzner and I am a Scala developer.  
My current interests in software development are Scala, Functional Programming and Reactive Programming.  
I have been in the field since 2008 working in JEE projects at banks as Bradesco, telecommunications companies as Telefônica and Vivo, government departments as TRE-SP (Tribunal Regional Eleitoral - São Paulo) and since 2014 I am working at Eicon developing systems in Scala to manage municipal services.  
Learning new technologies and learn the best way to apply them is my hobby but I like to make new friends, try new kinds of beer and play games too :smile:  
I majored in Information Systems at Faculdade Sumaré in 2010 and thenceforth I am studying on my own, reading some books, testing new things and sometimes doing an awesome MOOC course. I am OCPJ certified.  
I was born in 1986, I live in Sao Paulo (Brazil)  and I am married.
